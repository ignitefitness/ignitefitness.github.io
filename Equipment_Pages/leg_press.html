        <h3>Safety Tips</h3>
            <ol class="list">
                <li>Warm up for at least 5 minutes by stretching beforehand</li>
                <li>Start at a small weight you are comfortable with and work your way up to heavier weights</li>
                <li>Use the yellow release lever to adjust the platform to be a comfortable position when your knees are bent. Make sure the lever locks into place after any adjustment you make</li>
            </ol>
        
        <h3> Recommended Usage:</h3>
        
            <ol class="list">
                <li>Sit on the seat, making sure your back is pressed against the support of the seat and you are gripping the handles firmly</li>
                <li>Place your feet on the platform, hip-width apart. Extend your legs without locking your knees</li>
                <li>Inhale as you straighten your legs to push the platform forward, until your knees are completely flexed</li>
                <li>Slowly flex your knees in the opposite direction to return to the starting position, exhaling as you do so</li>
            </ol>
