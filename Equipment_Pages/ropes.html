        <h3>Safety Tips</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make sure you are far enough away from other people so you do not accidently harm them</li>
            <li>When doing waves, the energy should be mostly coming from the elbow joints, not the shoulders.</li>
        </ol>


        <h3>Recommended Usage:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pick up the ropes.</li>
            <li>Stand with your knees slightly bent, chest forward, and back straight, similar to how you would be
                standing when squatting.</li>
            <li>Make heavy motions with the ropes; most people use up and down waves.</li>
            <li>When doing waves, you can either do one arm at a time, or heavier repetitions when doing both arms
                at
                the same time.</li>
            <li>You may also go side to side or do circles to involve different parts of the body.</li>
            <li>You can add resistance by stepping toward the anchor, or decrease it by stepping away from it.</li>
        </ol>
