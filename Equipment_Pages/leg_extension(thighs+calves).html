        <h3>Safety Tips</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Warm up for at least 5 minutes by stretching beforehand</li>
            <li>Start at a small weight you are comfortable with and work your way up to heavier weights</li>
            <li>Make sure the yellow lever locks into place after any adjustment you make</li>
            <li>Raise the thigh pad when getting off of the machine, and do not get off while pushing the ankle pad
                downward</li>
        </ol>


        <h3>Recommended Usage:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Adjust the yellow lever behind the seat so that your knees are under the thigh pad when you sit in the
                seat</li>
            <li>Adjust the yellow lever so the thigh pad is on top of your thighs</li>
            <li>Place your ankles on top of the ankle pad and grip the handles</li>
            <li>Flex your legs downwards, lowering the ankle pad to be below the seat</li>
            <li>Slowly flex your legs upward to return to the starting position</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 for your desired number of reps</li>
        </ol>
