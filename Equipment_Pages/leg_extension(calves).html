            <li>Warm up for at least 5 minutes by stretching beforehand</li>
            <li>Start at a small weight you are comfortable with and work your way up to heavier weights</li>
            <li>Always keep your back against the backrest</li>

        <h3> Recommended Usage:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Sit with your back against the backrest. Position your legs so that your ankles are behind the ankle
                pad, and place your hands on the handles</li>
            <li>Lift the ankle pad with your legs while you inhale, keeping your legs almost straight, but not locked
