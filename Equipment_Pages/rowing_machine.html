        <h3>Safety Tips</h3>
            <ol class="list">
                <li>Warm up 5-10 minutes beforehand by stretching</li>
                <li>Start at a resistance between 3-5 until you know how much is right for you</li>
            </ol>
        
         
        <h3> Recommended Usage:</h3>
           
        <p>Do not make the mistake of using your entire body all at once. You should instead progress from using your legs, then your core, and then your arms. You may increase the difficulty by selecting the up arrow button on the right side of the input buttons.</p>
            
            <ol class="list">
                <li>Strap your feet in securely. Bend your knees at the front of the machine. Grab the handle with both hands, and make sure your back is straight.</li>
                <li>Push off with your leg muscles.</li>
                <li>When your legs are straightened out, lean back slightly, while keeping your back straight.</li>
                <li>Bend your elbows to pull the handle towards your chest.</li>
                <li>Extend your arms and reach your chest forward.</li>
                <li>Bend your knees to move forward to the starting position.</li>
                <li>Repeat steps 2-6 for the amount of rows you wish to complete.</li>
            </ol>
