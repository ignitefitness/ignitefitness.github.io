        <h3>Safety Tips</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Use the yellow lever to adjust the seat to a comfortable position, and make sure it locks into
                place.</li>
            <li>Start at a small weight and gradually use heavier ones.</li>
        </ol>


        <h3>Recommended Uses:</h3>

        <img src="../GIFs/pec.gif">
        <ol>
            <li>Use the yellow levers at the top of the machine to position the arms to a position labeled “pec”.
                Make sure each arm is set at the same setting.</li>
            <li>Sit on the seat facing away from the machine and grab the handles that face downward.</li>
            <li>Use your shoulder and chest muscles to push the arms of the machine together with your arms. Go
                slowly, and make sure you are going at the same pace for each arm.</li>
            <li>When the arms of the machine touch, slowly allow them to go back to their resting position.</li>
