        <h3>Safety Tips</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Warm up 5-10 minutes beforehand by stretching</li>
            <li> Make sure you start with a small weight you are comfortable with and work your way up to heavier ones
            </li>
            <li>When returning to the starting position, do not move the handles beyond your chest as to not put
                excessive weight on your shoulders</li>
        </ol>


        <h3> Recommended Usage:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Begin by adjusting the seat to a height that allows you to align the handles with the middle of your
                chest</li>
            <li>While leaning against the padding, press the handles outwards without locking your elbows</li>
            <li>Exhale as you press the handles away from your chest</li>
            <li>Inhale as you allow the handles to come back in towards your chest</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 2 -4 until you have achieved your desired number of repetitions</li>

        </ol>
