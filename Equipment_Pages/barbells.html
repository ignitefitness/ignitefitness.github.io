                <li>Warm up for 5-10 mins by stretching.</li>
                <li>When lifting a barbell off of or placing one back on, get close to the rack, bend with your knees (not hips), and keep your arms bent.</li>

                <li>Never hyperextend any part of your body (don’t push beyond your limits).</li>
            </ol>
