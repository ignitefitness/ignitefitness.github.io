        <h3>Safety Tips</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Warm up for 5-10 mins by stretching.</li>
            <li>When lifting a barbell off of or placing one back on, get close to the rack, bend with your knees (not
                hips), and keep your arms bent.</li>
            <li>Be mindful of other people, equipment, and safety hazards around you.</li>
            <li>Start at a small weight and progressively use heavier ones; do not use weights that are too heavy for
                you.</li>
            <li>Never hyperextend any part of your body (donâ€™t push beyond your limits).</li>
        </ol>

                muscles drawn in tight and knees slightly bent.</li>
            <li>Grab the barbell with an underhand grip, keeping your arms lowered by your thighs and your arms slightly
                bent. This is the starting position.</li>
            <li>Slowly raise the barbell to your upper chest, squeezing your bicep muscles as you do so.</li>
            <li>Hold the position for a count of time you are comfortable with, then slowly lower your arms to return to
                the starting position. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for however many reps you wish to complete.</li>

                abdominal muscles tight.</li>
            <li>While keeping your hands shoulder-width apart, grab the barbell with an overhand grip. Fully extend your
                arms and hold the barbell above your head.</li>
            <li>Slowly bring the barbell down towards your body while making sure it is in line with your chin and hold.
            </li>

                holding a barbell above your head.</li>
            <li>While keeping your elbows in place, slowly lower the barbell by flexing your elbow joint until it almost
                touches the top of your head. Squeeze your triceps and hold.</li>
            <li>Slowly flex your elbow joint in the opposite direction to return to the previous position. Repeat steps
                2 and 3 for however many reps you wish to complete.</li>
