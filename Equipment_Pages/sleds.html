            <li>Warm up 5-10 minutes before you start using the sled by stretching</li>
            <li>Make sure you use comfortable amount of weight that is equally distributed on both sides of the
                Sled.
            </li>
            <li>Make sure people are not in your way while you push the sled.</li>
