        <h3>Safety Tips</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make sure to lift or lower the seat to a comfortable level and that it locks into place.</li>
            <li>Adjust the straps so that it has a secure grip around your foot, so that it feels snug but not tight.
            </li>
            <li>While you start pedaling don't hunch your back to avoid neck pain.</li>
            <li>Make sure to hydrate frequently</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Recommended Usage:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Start pedaling to turn the bike on, then set it to a desired resistance level.</li>
            <li>Pedal at a comfortable speed, keeping in mind that higher speeds and resistance levels increase your
                heart rate.</li>
            <li>Keep pedaling on the bike until you are finished</li>
        </ol>
