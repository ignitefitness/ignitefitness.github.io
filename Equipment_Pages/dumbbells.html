        <h3>Safety Tips</h3>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>Warm up for 5-10 minutes by stretching.</li>
            <li>Be mindful of other people, equipment, and safety hazards around you.</li>
            <li>Start at a small weight and progressively use heavier ones; do not use weights that are too heavy for
                you.</li>
            <li>Never hyperextend any part of your body (don’t push beyond your limits).</li>
            <li>Never lock your elbows at any time when using dumbbells.</li>
        </ol>


        <h3> Recommended Uses:</h3>

        <h4>Overhead Press</h4>
        <img src="../GIFs/dumbbell_overhead_press.gif">
        <ol>
            <li>Hold a set of dumbbells in your hands. Place your hands at shoulder height and allow your palms to face
                up.</li>
            <li>Extend your arms slowly until they are straight and each dumbbell is above your head. Squeeze your
                shoulder muscles and hold for a moment, then lower your arms.</li>
            <li>Repeat step 2 for your desired number of reps.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Bench Press</h4>
        <img src="../GIFs/dumbbell_benchpress.gif">
        <ol>
            <li>Set a bench to the flat position. Sit on the end of it with a dumbbell in each hand, then lay face-up on
                the bench. Make sure your feet are planted firmly on the ground.</li>
            <li>Bend your elbows to be at about 90-degree angles. They should be in line with your shoulders and your
                arms should be reaching up.</li>
            <li>Slowly extend your elbows to push the dumbbells toward the ceiling, then slowly flex your elbows in the
                opposite direction to lower them. Breath in when you are lowering the dumbbells and breath out when you
                are raising them.</li>
            <li>Repeat step 3 for however many reps you wish to complete.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Cross-Body Hammer Curl</h4>
        <img src="../GIFs/dumbbell_cross_body_hammer_curl.gif">
        <ol>
            <li>Stand with a dumbbell in each hand and face your palms toward your body.</li>
            <li>Curl one of the dumbbells up towards the opposite shoulder by moving your arm across your body. Squeeze
                your bicep muscle as you do so.</li>
            <li>Hold the dumbbell at your shoulder for a moment, then reverse the motion to bring it back down. Do the
                same motion for your other arm.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 for your desired number of reps.</li>
        </ol>
