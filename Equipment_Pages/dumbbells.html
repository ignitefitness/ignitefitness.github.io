                <li>Set a bench to the flat position. Sit on the end of it with a dumbbell in each hand, then lay face-up on the bench. Make sure your feet are planted firmly on the ground.</li>
                <li>Bend your elbows to be at about 90-degree angles. They should be in line with your shoulders and your arms should be reaching up.</li>
                <li>Slowly extend your elbows to push the dumbbells toward the ceiling, then slowly flex your elbows in the opposite direction to lower them. Breath in when you are lowering the dumbbells and breath out when you are raising them.</li>
